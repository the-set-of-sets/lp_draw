# lp_draw
This file defines a function which draws a unit ball in the Lp norm (for any positive integer p). It is written in Asymptote, a descriptive vector graphics language with C-like syntax. I used this function to draw diagrams for talk slides (see https://tinyurl.com/yarwx6ky) and for fun. 

Here is an example application: https://i.imgur.com/d7ilklM.jpg
